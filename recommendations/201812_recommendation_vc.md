Valentina was Antonio's teacher

## Text

Antonio was a brilliant and talented student. He performed exceptionally well since he started the master degree in 2016 when I first met him, as professor of the Secure System Design course. I had the opportunity to closely work with him, being his tutor during his Master thesis, that was developed in collaboration with the Montimage SME, in Paris, within the ANASTASIA H2020 project. He has a very good profile, and a wide-spectrum preparation in computer engineering, furthermore, he is very enquiring and this motivates him to always deeply investigate the problems to face.
