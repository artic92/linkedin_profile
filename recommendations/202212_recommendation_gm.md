I had the pleasure of meeting Antonio when he was a participant at the International Space University's Space Studies Program (SSP) 2021 in Strasbourg, France, when I was on assignment as the Director of the SSP. Antonio worked on the MOONPORT team project, sponsored by Virgin Galactic and the Breakthrough Foundation. The project focused on creating an innovative concept of a reusable space tug for cargo transportation to the Moon. During the SSP, Antonio demonstrated strong leadership and teamwork skills in all his academic activities. He helped others on his teams and took initiative when needed, undertaking additional work outside scheduled time to enhance the results of team challenges while sharing his passion with colleagues and mentors. There were no assignments he would not tackle. He always displayed strong enthusiasm and creativity. Antonio was a constant encouragement to all who interacted with him. I highly recommend Antonio to other organizations or professional development programs. I look forward to seeing his enthusiasm and entrepreneurial skills shine within the space industry.
