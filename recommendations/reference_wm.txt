Mr. Antonio Riccio has shown during his internship in Montimage autonomy and reflection skills in relation to complex
topics dealing with security in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) based on Internet of Things (IoT), from theoretical and
practical points of views. He has demonstrated an excellent ability to master theories and software. He brilliantly
extended Montimage monitoring software tool to support the 6LoWPAN protocol and worked on a demonstration that he
successfully presented in the ANASTACIA project meeting. I recommend this guy :)
