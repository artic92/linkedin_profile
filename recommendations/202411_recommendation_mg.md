I collaborated with Matthias on the Mission Possible spacecraft at The Exploration Company. Although we were part of different teams, our collaboration was close, and his support was vital in tackling several challenges.

I appreciated his ability to explain complex concepts straightforwardly, which fostered collaboration and allowed us to navigate complex issues in a quick and efficient way. Besides his technical acumen are his proactive mindset and dependability. Whether troubleshooting a critical issue or brainstorming innovative solutions, Matthias was always quick to step up.

I recommend Matthias to anyone looking for a talented, reliable, and team-focused professional. It was an honour to work with him, and I do not doubt that he will excel in any future endeavour.
