I  had the pleasure of getting to know Antonio in my capacities as teaching associate during the Executive Space Course at the International Space University in 2023. From the moment I met him, it was clear that Antonio is not just a passive enthusiast of space science but a passionate and driven individual who consistently seeks opportunities to expand his knowledge within the field. His boundless energy, insatiable curiosity, and unwavering motivation set him apart.

Throughout the course, Antonio stood out as an exceptional participant, infusing classes with enthusiasm and a deep well of knowledge in flight software engineering. His dedication to pushing the boundaries of his understanding and his eagerness to share insights with his peers were evident. Antonio's exceptional interpersonal skills were matched only by his professionalism and remarkable aptitude in software engineering.

Without hesitation, I wholeheartedly recommend Antonio, who will undoubtedly bring a significant positive contribution to any working environment. His character, skills, and commitment to the space science community make him a standout candidate for any endeavour he chooses to pursue. I am eagerly anticipating the remarkable contributions he will surely make to the future of space exploration, and I am confident that he is destined for great success.
