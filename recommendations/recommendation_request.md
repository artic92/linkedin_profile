Would You Mind Writing a Recommendation?

### Example text

Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m updating my LinkedIn profile to reflect my recent projects and experiences, and I was wondering if you’d be open to writing a recommendation for me. Having worked together on the SmartHome IoT project last year, I feel you’ve seen my approach to tackling challenges and collaborating with the team.

If you’re comfortable, it would be great if you could mention:

* My ability to quickly troubleshoot and resolve technical issues.
* How I worked collaboratively with the team to meet tight deadlines.
* My contributions to streamlining the system architecture, which helped improve efficiency.
Of course, feel free to add your own insights or highlight anything you feel stood out during our time working together.

I really appreciate your time and support, and I’d be happy to help in return if there’s anything you need.

Thank you so much, Sarah!

Ad Astra,
Antonio
