I met Roberto when he was working in London. For Roberto, cooking is not just a
job but something more important, that is why he puts a lot of passion in each
dish he prepares. I remained astonished by his ability to invent a great plate
with ingredients I have given him just a couple of minutes earlier. He is always
willing to share his knowledge with others, comprising people who are not expert
in the sector. He is very inspiring. I would warmly recommend him.

explanation, he patiently made sure everybody understood his comments and
suggestions, using simpler and clearer words if necessary. It has been a
pleasure and an honour working for him.

Dave and I worked in the same team at Airspan. Dave’s support has been
astonishingly essential during my first months. He showed great patience
explaining each doubt or question, even more than once, and he never got upset
every time I was going to ask him something. Even if he didn’t know the answer,
he was always keen to find it, and he was not happy until I got my doubts
solved. If we would need to thank someone for having saved my manager's time
from trivial questions, that is surely Dave.

I collaborated with Natalia during one of my recruiting processes. Despite her
young career, she was capable of managing quite challenging tasks with extensive
professionalism and attitude. I particularly found truly useful the coaching
sessions she organised in preparation for the interview with the company. She

solutions to get the best out of the candidate. By conveying the right awareness

the course. She displayed not only a profound passion for space but also an immense
capacity for nurturing her students' growth. Beyond her professional role, Gloria's
strength as a mother was also evident in her caring and supportive demeanour. She truly
embodies the qualities of a dedicated educator and an exceptional individual.

## Giuseppe Reccia

I had the pleasure of dining at Chucs during Giuseppe's tenure as Head Chef, and I must say it was an extraordinary culinary experience. Giuseppe's passion for his craft is palpable in every aspect of his work. From the moment I walked into the restaurant, his attention to detail was evident, both in the meticulously crafted dishes and the seamless service.

What truly stood out to me was Giuseppe's clear and engaging communication when he introduced me to his kitchen and team. It was apparent that he not only cared about the food but also valued the collaborative effort of his talented kitchen staff. The taste of his dishes was nothing short of exceptional, and I was surprised to discover his Instagram page, filled with stunning photos of his creations that mirrored the artistry on the plate. Giuseppe's commitment to using genuine ingredients was apparent, elevating every dish to a new level of excellence.

One particular highlight for me was the cavolo nero risotto, which I appreciated immensely. Giuseppe's attention to detail in explaining the dish and its ingredients added an extra layer of enjoyment to the dining experience. Recently, I had the privilege of booking an event at his establishment for my boss, and the quality of service and food left us both astonished. Giuseppe truly goes above and beyond to create memorable dining experiences. I highly recommend his expertise to anyone seeking exceptional cuisine and impeccable service.
