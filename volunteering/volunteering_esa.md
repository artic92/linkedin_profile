### Association description

The **Erasmus Student Association Napoli (ESA Napoli)** is a non-profit organization run by Neapolitan university students, many of whom have participated in Erasmus programs themselves. Its mission is to help international students integrate into the city of Naples by offering free support, organizing cultural and social events, and fostering connections between local and international communities. The association provides a range of services, such as assistance with housing, navigating the city, and social integration, often facilitated by local volunteers and former Erasmus participants.
