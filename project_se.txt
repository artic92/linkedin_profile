GNSS Synchronization & Bistatic Passive Radar (VHDL,C)

Realization of IP cores for the subsystem in charge of synchronizing with a reference GNSS satellite. 
In collaboration with a research company, named Aster. 
Working in a team of 3. 
Project available on Github.

⚫️ Main Activities:
- Deep understanding of the radar global architecture
- Study of the synchronizer subsystem architecture
- Comparison of the different solutions proposed
- Assignment of tasks to each group member
- Collaborative development using GIT
- Designing with Xilinx VIVADO
- Writing internal documentation with DOXYGEN
- Linux device drivers development
- Writing test-benches to test the functional validity
- Collaboration with other teams for integration
- Testing activities using Zybo Zynq-7000 SoC boards
- Project documentation writing
- Presentation of the advancements to the stakeholders

Thanks to my team contribution, the Aster company reduced times to get a working version of the radar.

As the final task of "Embedded Systems" course, I took part in a project aiming to produce a bistatic passive radar: a
system which computes distances from objects employing GNSS systems (Galileo, GPS, and GLONASS). I worked in a team of 3
students. My team contributed to the subsystem in charge of synchronizing with the reference satellite. In other words,
this subsystem looks for the best GNSS signal to use as a comparison with the signal bounced from an obstacle in order
to compute its distance.

In particular, my team realized three IP core. The first takes in input a complex signal with fixed frequency and phase
and outputs the modulus of that signal. The second IP core takes in input the signal coming from the first IP core and
confront it with the maximum modulus known so far. The block outputs the value of the maximum module, along with the
frequency and the phase the modulus referred to.
