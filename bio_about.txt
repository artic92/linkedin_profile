Young Embedded Engineer striving to commence a career in the space industry. Amazed about everything crosses space: from
satellites & probes to rockets & spaceships. My passion is to discover each detail concerning the reliability and safety
of computer hardware & software. Enthusiast about Linux Kernel and hard believer in the power of bash to solve each
problem.

Passionate, Motivated, Curious and Ambitious are my most identifying traits. I am very fond of astronomy and physics. I
love reading books regarding relativistic & quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and psychology. I enjoy doing sport as well.
I practice jogging but I love to swim and play football also. 

I would love to conclude with these words:

it’s incredibly helpful." [E.Musk]
