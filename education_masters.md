Abstract:

The emergence of the IoT paradigm is one of the most spectacular phenomena of the last decade. The IoT materialises a vision of a future Internet where any object possessing computing and sensorial capabilities is able to communicate using Internet protocols. All these devices are characterised with strict constraints in terms of resources available, while their difficult deployment requires also the use of batteries for energy storage. Such factors obstacle the adoption of the most diffused, but heavy, security mechanisms. Consequently, the attention shifts towards the monitoring of security. This dissertation tries to give a contribution in that direction, by proposing a solution to perform multi-layer security monitoring within the IoT.

Main activities:

* analysed the consequences of a not universally acknowledged definition of the IoT
* surveyed the most diffused IoT Reference Architectures, in particular the Cisco IoT Reference Model
* focused the research on the Connectivity Level of the IoT Reference Model (level 2)
* analysed the security model of the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol
* analysed the actual security measures adopted at each level of the 6LoWPAN stack
* analysed vulnerabilities and threats according to the IAS Octave classification per each level of the 6LoWPAN stack
* compared several solutions comprising the state-of-the-art in terms of IDS for the IoT
* experimental tests on the platform offered by the ANASTACIA infrastructure

Title: *A Security Monitoring System for the Internet of Things*

Abstract:

The wide adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm in several application domains has raised new security issues, which should be carefully taken into account to achieve a real benefit from the indisputable innovation potential of IoT. In fact, the heterogeneity of involved technologies, including the integration of different resource-constrained devices and networks, has led to the introduction of new threats affecting all architectural layers and urging for the design and enforcement of adequate security countermeasures, including effective monitoring capabilities. In this paper, we present a monitoring tool for IoT systems based on the extension of the Montimage network monitoring tools. The proposed solution, validated within the H2020 ANASTACIA project, proved to be well suited to monitor IoT-level networks thanks to the exploitation of protocol-specific plugins.
