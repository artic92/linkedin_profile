# Experience: Montimage

## Title

Software Engineer Intern

## Company

Montimage

The core business of Montimage is developing tools for testing and monitoring networks,

security aspects and improving context awareness and end-user trust.

## Location

Paris, France

## Period

Jan 2018 - Aug 2018

## Description

Realisation of an Intrusion Detection System for Cyber-physical Systems (CPS)
and the Internet of Things (IoT). Activity framed in the context of the ANASTACIA EU project.

Erasmus-granted internship in the context of the master's thesis. Montimage HQ. R&D Department.

Main activities:

* design and development of application software in procedural C
* integration and reuse of legacy solutions from previous projects
* debugging software for investigation/studying purposes using GDB
* preliminary integration testing inside the Cooja Network Simulator
* benign and malicious traffic generation for subsequent testing phases
* analysis and study of network traffic through Wireshark and tcpdump
* definition of a simulated target environment through virtual machines
* integration testing on the simulated environment
* deployment and integration testing on the ANASTACIA real target environment
* arranged integration and system testing strategies with project partners
* performed system testing in collaboration with ANASTACIA partners
* log gathering from the target for subsequent study
* participation in conference calls and project meetings
* contributing to ANASTACIA documentation deliverables (D4.1 and D4.3)

## Impacts

* ~~Contributed significantly to letting the company start the business in the IoT~~

NOTE: so far (02/2020), there is no mention on their website about MMT-IoT; therefore, I would
wait to put this statement until they update their website.

* Contributed significantly to the definition of an operational prototype capable of working in many scenarios
