## Description

The course gives a broad introduction to the Aerospace Engineering by
introducing fundamental concepts of propulsion and orbital mechanics. Then, the
contents move toward human spaceflight by introducing how environmental control
and life support systems work and analysing how an extravehicular activity is
carried out both in orbit and on the ground. The course also focuses on human
physiology and, in particular, to the effects that weightlessness has on the
human body.

## Keywords

Aerospace Engineering, Orbital Mechanics, Propulsion, Environmental Control and
Life Support, Microgravity and Space Physiology, System Safety, Extravehicular
Activity.
