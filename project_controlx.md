## Description

ControlX is a C-based framework for sensor data processing and control in spacecraft systems. It simulates interactions between sensors and actuators, including fault tolerance mechanisms such as Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR).

## Skills

Embedded software, C, object-oriented design, Docker.

## Media

### Github repository

ControlX processes data from three sensors (IMU, GNSS, Star Trackers) and controls six thrusters based on this data. It demonstrates real-time sensor data processing, fault detection, and system extensibility through modular architecture.
