Producing technical documentation for the Cache Coherence Subsystem.
Part of the European project MANGO.

HINT: prova a trovare il WP di riferimento per la documentazione del core nu+.

⚫️ Main activities:
- Learning SystemVerilog syntax fundamentals
- Deep understanding of Cache Coherence Subsystem functioning
- Brainstormings regarding documentation contents
- Static analysis of source files
- Aligning existing documentation to the newest advancements
- Presenting work advancements
- Producing documentation sections on the newest subsystems

HINT: prova a ricordare di quali subsystems non esisteva una doc prima

During the "Advanced Computer Architecture & GPU programming" class I was asked to write down part of the documentation for the core nu+, an open-source core developed for the H2020 project MANGO. In particular, I wrote the part regarding cache coherence. A deep study of the core implementation files was taken in order to write the documentation.

European project under Horizon2020 funding. In the context of "Advanced Computer Architecture & GPU programming" course.
