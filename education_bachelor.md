## Description

Thesis: *Analysis of RabbitMQ for development of message-oriented applications*

Supervisor: Prof. Marcello Cinque

Abstract:

In this work, one of the most diffused message-oriented middleware is analysed: the RabbitMQ. The discussion focuses on an in-depth analysis of the middleware followed by the study of the main communication protocol adopted, namely AMQP.  There is also a brief guide explaining how to develop a simple application that uses the RabbitMQ API. The analysis ends with a comparison with another widespread middleware solution, the Apache ActiveMQ.
