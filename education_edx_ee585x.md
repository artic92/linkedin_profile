## Description

This course builds on university-level physics and mechanics to introduce and
illustrate orbital dynamics as is applied in the design of space missions.
Simple tools are provided to allow planning of missions on orbit around Earth or
in the Solar System.

The course focuses on conceptual understanding of space mechanics, manoeuvres,
propulsion and control systems used in all spacecraft. Moreover, it analyses the
challenges related to the use of the space environment as a platform for
scientific and utilitarian purposes.
