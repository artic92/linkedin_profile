# Summary

Recent graduate in Computer Engineering with specialization in Embedded and
Industrial Systems. A reliable, hardworking individual with excellent knowledge
of C programming, VLSI design, VHDL and validation techniques. I am currently
seeking an opportunity to develop new skills and build my career as a Graduate
Engineer.

My research interests focus on reliability of reprogrammable electronic devices
and processors in space environments, fault tolerance optimization against
radiation effects in microelectronic circuits, and fault
detection-isolation-and-recovery (FDIR) techniques.
