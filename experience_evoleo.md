### ESA PLATO

ESAâ€™s mission Plato, PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars, will use its 26 cameras to study terrestrial exoplanets in orbits up to the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The mission will measure the sizes of exoplanets and discover exomoons and rings around them. Plato will also characterise planets' host stars by studying tiny light variations in the starlight it receives.

### Ancillary Electrical Units (AEU)

The Ancillary Electronic Units (AEUs) have the following main functions:

* to supply secondary power to the Front End Electronics (FEE) of each camera.
* to synchronise the various sub-systems: Cameras, AEUs internal power converters and camera heating.

### CHICS

CHICS aims to develop an On-Board Computer (OBC) based on COTS and MPSoC
technology that is easily customisable and adaptable to the needs of different
missions. The design complies with the ESA SAVOIR reference architecture for
spacecraft hardware and software. In collaboration with Airbus Defence & Space
GmbH.
