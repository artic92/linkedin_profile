## Description

### PLATO - PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars

PLATO is the third medium-class (M-class) mission in the Cosmic Vision programme
by ESA with a budget of approximately **500 million euros**. Its objective is
double-sided. On the one hand, to find and study extrasolar planetary systems,
emphasising terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around solar-like stars.
On the other hand, study and characterise the planet host star, including its
age.

My involvement focused on designing and developing the *Ancillary
Electrical Units (AEU)* for the Service Module.

Main activites:

* FPGA design & development compliant with ECSS-Q-ST-60-02C
* VHDL modelling according to ESA ASIC/001 guidelines
* supported automated FPGA functional verification
* integration of Microsemi and ESA IP Cores
* working with SpaceWire RMAP as per ECSS-E-ST-50-52C
* working with AMBA 3 AHB-Lite specification
* mentored junior engineers
* managed a team of three
* production of project deliverables
* production of internal documentation
* regular meeting and reviews with the customer
* activities planning within the team
* digital design for Microsemi RTAX-S/SL radiation-tolerant FPGAs
* digital design for Microsemi proASIC industrial FPGAs
* unit and system-level testing

### CHICS - COTS-based Highly Integrated Computer Systems

CHICS aims to develop an On-Board Computer (OBC) based on COTS and MPSoC
technology that is easily customisable and adaptable to the needs of different
missions. The design complies with the ESA SAVOIR reference architecture for
spacecraft hardware and software. In collaboration with Airbus Defence & Space
GmbH.

My contribution focused on supporting the digital design of the CHICS OBC.

Main activites:

* digital design for Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC
* digital design for Microsemi PolarFire FPGA

## Impacts

* improved VHDL code quality by introducing industry-standard methodologies and
  procedures
