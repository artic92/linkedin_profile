## Description

Realization of IP cores for the subsystem in charge of synchronizing with a reference GNSS satellite.
In collaboration with a research company, named Aster.
Working in a team of 3.
Project available on Github.

Main Activities:

* Deep understanding of the radar global architecture
* Study of the synchronizer subsystem architecture
* Comparison of the different solutions proposed
* Assignment of tasks to each group member
* Collaborative development using GIT
* Designing with Xilinx VIVADO
* Writing internal documentation with DOXYGEN
* Linux device drivers development
* Writing test-benches to test the functional validity
* Collaboration with other teams for integration
* Testing activities using Zybo Zynq-7000 SoC boards
* Project documentation writing
* Presentation of the advancements to the stakeholders

## Achievements

Thanks to my team contribution, the Aster company reduced times to get a working version of the radar.
