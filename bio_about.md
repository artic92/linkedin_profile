# Bio

As an Embedded Software Engineer at The Exploration Company, I work on developing and testing software for space exploration missions, applying my knowledge of C programming, MISRA-C and unit testing. I enjoy solving challenging problems and ensuring the reliability and safety of the software systems.

I have a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering from Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, and I have completed several specializations and certifications in Interdisciplinary Space Studies, Astronautics, and Advanced English. I have also gained valuable experience as an FPGA Engineer at EVOLEO Technologies, where I designed and developed the Ancillary Electrical Units for the ESA's PLATO mission, following the ECSS-Q-ST-60-02C and ESA ASIC/001 guidelines. My research interests include fault tolerance optimization, radiation effects in microelectronic circuits, and FDIR techniques for space applications. I am passionate about aerospace and I aspire to contribute to the advancement of space exploration and technology.

I'm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, so feel free to connect with me if you share my passion for space and embedded systems. Let's collaborate and make meaningful connections!
