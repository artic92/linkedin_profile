Endorsement Request  

## Text

Hi [Name],  

I hope you’re doing well! I’m reaching out to ask for a small favour. As I continue building my presence on LinkedIn, I’m focusing on highlighting some of my key skills, including **[Skill 1]**, **[Skill 2]**, and **[Skill 3]**.  

Since we worked together on **[specific project or collaboration]**, I believe you’ve seen first-hand how I’ve applied these skills. If you feel comfortable, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could endorse me for them.  

Of course, I’d be happy to return the favour or support you in any way I can! Let me know if there’s something specific I can help with.  

Thanks so much for your time and support—it means a lot to me!  

Ad Astra,
Antonio
