# Recruiter rejection

Dear NAME,

Thank you so much for your interest towards my professional profile.

Your offer sounds very intriguing, and I am sure you are going to find someone as motivated and passionate as you for this opportunity. I am aiming towards local offers and not thinking about relocation at the moment.

I wish you all the best of luck for your hunt.

Ad Astra,
Antonio
