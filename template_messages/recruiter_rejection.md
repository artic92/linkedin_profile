# Recruiter rejection

Dear NAME,

thank you so much for your interest towards my professional profile.

You offer sounds very intriguing and I am sure you are going to find someone as motivated an passionate like you for this opportunity. I am aiming towards local offers and not thinking about relocation at the moment.

I wish you all the best luck for your hunt.

Ad Astra,
Antonio
