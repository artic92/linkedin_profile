# Recommendation request

Hi [Name],

I know you are busy. I will take as little time as possible.

Could you help me with something? I’m updating my LinkedIn profile and would appreciate it if you could write me a quick recommendation based on our time working together at [Company/Project].

It would mean a lot to hear your perspective on [specific strength, e.g., my work on Linux systems, our collaboration on XYZ, etc.]. If you need any pointers or reminders about particular projects we worked on, I’d be happy to help!

To speed things up, I will leave you with an example. Feel free to modify and change it (I don't mind chatGPT ;-)) as you like.

I appreciate any help you can provide. It means a lot! In exchange, I also wrote a recommendation for you :-).

Ad Astra,
Antonio
