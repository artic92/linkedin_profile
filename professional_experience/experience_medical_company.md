## Description

### Project: embedded software integration & validation for medical device

* Embedded software integration and validation within an IEC 62304 Class C context. Working with Zynq UltraScale+ SoCs (APU running QNX, RPU running RTOS) and Spartan FPGAs, including MicroBlaze CPUs. Maintaining software and configuration consistency across 7 parallel prototypes and ensuring correct behaviour after updates, configuration changes, or partial failures.
* Design and PowerShell development of automation scripts to support and automate error-prone deployment workflows. Unit and integration in a Docker-based environment. System tests on real device.
* Black box system-level tests to ensure traceability and compliance with internal verification processes. Investigated failed test cases by collecting data for root-cause analysis and generating defect reports with reproduction steps, logs, and relevant embedded debugging information.

## Accomplishments

* Significantly improved reliability and repeatability of embedded software delivery by automating manual deployment workflows, reducing human error and inconsistent system states during upgrades.
* Significantly reduced configuration-related failures by introducing version control for configuration files, preventing silent corruption caused by manual edits or hardware adjustments.
* Improved maintainability and knowledge transfer by documenting deployment and validation procedures in Markdown, ensuring version control, and generating PDF documentation for easy review by non-developer stakeholders.
