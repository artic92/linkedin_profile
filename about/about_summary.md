# About: summary

Linux is everywhere—and for good reason. Its ubiquity and broader support in embedded systems make it an unparalleled innovation tool. Over nearly a decade, I've applied my expertise in Linux and open-source technologies to create robust and scalable solutions in the aerospace, defence, and telecommunications industries. For instance, I've developed embedded software for the Nyx spacecraft, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the PLATO observatory, demonstrating my ability to thrive in the most demanding environments.

As a freelancer, I specialize in embedded software design, development, and testing for SoC, MPSoC, FPGA, and MCU platforms. Whether it's optimizing Linux deployments, building device drivers, or consulting on open-source strategies, my goal is to deliver solutions that are not just functional but built to last. Quality isn't just a checkbox for me—it's a mindset. I'm deeply passionate about promoting sound engineering principles, inspiring organizations to adopt these practices, and avoiding costly challenges down the line.

But my work continues beyond delivering projects. I'm committed to contributing to the open-source community I rely on daily, fostering collaboration. By advancing best practices and contributing to major open-source projects, I hope to give back to the community that has fueled my growth and helped shape the future of embedded systems.

Let's connect if you share my belief in the transformative power of Linux and open-source technologies or want to discuss how these tools can benefit your organization. I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push boundaries and create meaningful impact. Your ideas and contributions are important to me, and I look forward to the potential of our collaboration.
