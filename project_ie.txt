Field Failure Data Analysis (FFDA) Log-based (MATLAB)

Dependability analysis of data collected from Mercury and BlueGene/L supercomputers.

⚫️ Main activities:
- Grouping log entries with a defined coalescence window
- Computing Dependability parameters (MTTF, MTBF, Availability, Reliability)
- Fitting the distribution for the reliability (Exponential, Weibull, Hyperexponential)
- Goodness of fit study with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
- Analysis per node and per error category
- Writing internal documentation
