## Description

Development of DAL Level A on-board software for the Eurofighter Typhoon
class aircraft.

Eurofighter Typhoon is the world’s most advanced swing-role combat aircraft,
providing simultaneously deployable Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface capabilities.

Typhoon’s Flight Control Computer (FCC) is a quadruplex-redundant control system
enabling the first digital fly-by-wire aircraft without mechanical backup controls.
These computers house the Flight Computer Software (FCS), which controls the control
surfaces to aerodynamically stabilise the plane and enable the pilot to fly it.

My contribution as part of the Software Team was to participate in all the phases of
the DAL-A Flight Control Software (FCS) development for the integration of a
new pressure sensor. Software Team led by Jon Rimmer.

Main activities:

* analysing requirements specification
* design test cases following the MC/DC coverage
* execute tests with Mathworks VectorCast
* tuning test cases to improve coverage metrics
* static analysis of source and assembler code

## Impacts

* successful software integration of the new TIPS pressure sensor
