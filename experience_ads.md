## Description

Eurofighter Typhoon is the world’s most advanced swing-role combat aircraft
providing simultaneously deployable Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface capabilities.

Typhoon’s Flight Control Computer (FCC) is a quadruplex-redundant control system
capable of enabling the first digital fly-by-wire aircraft to fly without mechanical
backup controls. These computers house the Flight Computer Software (FCS) which
controls the control surfaces to aerodynamically stabilise the aircraft and enable
the pilot to fly it.

My contribution as part of the Software Team is to to participate in all the phases
of the development of the Flight Control Software (FCS). Software Team led by Jon Rimmer.

Main activities:

* analysing requirements specification
* design test-cases adopting the MC/DC criteria
* execute tests with Mathworks VectorCast
* tuning test-cases to improve coverage metrics
